# PROBLEM: 

<br>
<br>

- Most of the fish farmers suffer great loss due to the fluctuations in pH and temperature of the   water body.
- Fish farmers had to move long distance through water just to feed fishes.
- In most cases ,unexperienced farmers faces the problem of uneven distribution of food which leads to non uniform growth of fishes and remaining food leads growth to the accumulation of ammonia in water. 
  
- Due to busy schedules owners cannot feed properly.

- Improper biowaste management

- An affordable commercial model that integrates two sensors into a device is yet to be developed.

- Even though we could acquire data, we still doesn't have an easy access to it along with proper notification.

# FEEDO 

Aquatic farm assistant
<br>
<br>

<p class="p-5px mt-[10%]">
Feedo is an iot inspired device which is an semi automatic variant of feeder and parameter analyser for aquatic farms. Feedo help the fish farmers in minimizing the headache of managing the fish farm manually. The aquatic robo device can keep track of the pH and temperature of water body. Feedo alert the farmers when the parameters go below or above a specified range. Feedo can be used to feed fish and the device is software controlled.Data collected by the device is uploaded into a cloud server which can be accessed by the farmer whenever or wherever they want.
  
  Keynotes

  - cloud
  - Temperature checking
  - pH checking
  - App
  - User can control the feed time wherever in the world
