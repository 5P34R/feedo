# PROBLEM: 

<br>
<br>

- Most of the fish farmers suffer great loss due to the improper maintain Ph and temperature of the   water body.
- Fish farmers had to move long distance through water just to feed fishes.
- In most cases ,unexperienced farmers faces the problem of uneven distribution of food which leads to non uniform growth of fishes and remaining food leads growth to the accumulation of ammonia in water. 
  
- Due to busy schedules owners cannot feed properly.

- Due to the feeding many owners cannot spend time outside
